I am a Software Engineer at [Planning Center](https://planning.center/), where I write beautiful church management applications using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

I enjoy learning new technologies, both for fun and on the job. When I'm not working, I also enjoy reading, knitting, and spending time with my family.

This site is where I keep track of my journey as a developer and my projects. Occasionally I will also blog about some other stuff I find interesting too.
